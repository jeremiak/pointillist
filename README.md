# Pointillist

Small little library to color in HTML elements in the pop art style of [Roy Lichtenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Lichtenstein).

Here's a small [demo](https://jeremiak.github.io/pointillist)

## Usage
The function attaches itself to `pointillist` on the `window` object. To use, just call with a selector, the diamter of the dots and the color.

`pointillist('.circle', '10px', 'RebeccaPurple');`
